# Sustainability-Machine-Learning-Challenge
Though a little late in the day, the world is waking up to the deleterious effect of fossil fuels on our environment. As the doomsday clock ticks away, human beings are turning to renewable energy to avert a possible apocalypse. Fortunately, the sun is a well-spring of clean energy. Taking the cue, Wipro, in association with MachineHack, has designed a forecasting challenge to optimise solar power generation using ML models.  A solar power generation company wants to optimize solar power production and needs the prediction model to predict ‘Clearsky DHI’, ‘Clearsky DNI’, ‘Clearsky GHI’. The data is ten years at an interval of every 30 mins with the following data points:  ['Year', 'Month', 'Day', 'Hour', 'Minute', 'Temperature', 'Clearsky DHI', 'Clearsky DNI', 'Clearsky GHI', 'Cloud Type', 'Dew Point', 'Fill Flag', 'Relative Humidity', 'Solar Zenith Angle', 'Pressure', 'Precipitable Water', 'Wind Direction', 'Wind Speed']
